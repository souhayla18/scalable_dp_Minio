# Scalable Data Engineering Pipeline

## Overview
This project establishes a scalable data engineering pipeline designed to ingest, process, and store data from multiple sources. Leveraging powerful data technologies, this pipeline ensures robust scalability, reliability, and efficiency in handling both real-time and batch data.

## Architecture

## Key Components

1. **Data Sources**: Ingests data from a variety of sources:
   - **APIs**, **Databases**, **File Systems**, and **Real-Time Streams**.

2. **Data Ingestion**:
   - **Apache Airflow**: Orchestrates and schedules data ingestion tasks with error handling.
   - **Python Scripts**: Custom scripts for specialized extraction and transformation.
   - **AWS Lambda**: Executes serverless functions for event-driven data processing.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - **Cassandra**: NoSQL storage solution for structured and semi-structured data.
   - **MinIO**: Object storage designed for large datasets and files.

4. **Data Processing**:
   - **Apache Spark**: Distributed processing for data cleaning, transformation, and analytics.
   - **Python**: Additional data processing for feature engineering.
   - **Spark SQL**: SQL-like queries for data manipulation.
   - **Spark Streaming**: Processes and analyzes real-time data streams.

5. **Data Serving**:
   - **ClickHouse**: Columnar database for high-performance analytical queries.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for specific reporting and ad hoc querying needs.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics and logs.
   - **Prometheus**: Gathers and stores metrics.
   - **Alerting Systems**: Notifies users of critical issues in real time.

## Data Flow Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Data from sources like APIs, databases, and file systems is ingested through **Python scripts** or **AWS Lambda**.
   - **Apache Airflow** schedules and monitors ingestion tasks for reliability.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Data is stored in **Cassandra** for structured and semi-structured information.
   - Large files are stored in **MinIO** for efficient handling and retrieval.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - **Apache Spark** performs data transformations, feature engineering, and other processing tasks.

4. **Data Serving**:
   - Processed data is loaded into **ClickHouse** for fast analytical queries.
   - Specific datasets are stored in **PostgreSQL** for relational data analysis.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Metrics and logs are monitored with **Grafana** and **Prometheus**.
   - Alerts notify users of critical issues, ensuring prompt response.

## Benefits
- **Scalability**: Distributed components like Apache Spark, Cassandra, and MinIO enable the handling of extensive datasets.
- **Reliability**: Apache Airflow enhances pipeline reliability with fault-tolerant scheduling.
- **Flexibility**: Modular architecture simplifies adding new sources or processing steps.
- **Performance**: ClickHouse and optimized processing enhance query speeds.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Cloud-based, open-source tools minimize costs.

## Future Enhancements
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Embed ML models for predictive insights and analytics.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Improve real-time processing with Apache Kafka or Apache Flink.
- **Data Governance**: Implement governance policies for data quality and security.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate data mining, ML, and other analytics for deeper insights.
